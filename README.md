# HomeLabGroup

### Generalities 

We will discuss what a HomeLab is and its various benefits. Old and underutilized hardware can be repurposed to control IOT devices or to bring amusement by serving new functions. By upcycling old devices, we can create less e-waste as well as reclaim personal ownership.

Participants will set up a hosting environment on their own machines. We will debate the types of hypervisors and the benefits of bare metal. Participants will be shown how to create virtual machines and containers.


### March 28,2024
#### Chicago 

Let's begin our homelab journey together. During this event the participants will be provided with a roadmap for activities that will culminate in the creation of self built and self hosted systems. Each month we will add on to our individual homelabs by adding networking, compute and other assets that increase functionality and overall user enjoyment. No experience needed aside from a genuine open curiosity.
